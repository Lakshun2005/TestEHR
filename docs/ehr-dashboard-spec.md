# Feature Specification: EHR Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `[ehr-dashboard]`  
**Created**: September 27, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a comprehensive, production-ready Electronic Health Record (EHR) dashboard. The application must be secure, performant, and provide a seamless user experience for healthcare providers.\n\nCore Functional Pillars:\n1. Patient Management Hub: A central dashboard for viewing, searching, and managing patient records.\n2. AI-Powered Clinical Decision Support: AI integration for real-time risk assessment, diagnostic assistance, and drug interaction checking.\n3. Advanced Data Visualization: A dedicated analytics section with interactive charts for clinical metrics.\n4. Smart Documentation System: AI-assisted tools for generating clinical notes and voice-to-text transcription.\n5. Communication & Workflow Tools: Features for secure team messaging and task management.\n\nTechnical Stack & Architecture:\nFrontend: Next.js 14+ (App Router, React Server Components), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.\nBackend & Database: Supabase (Postgres), Prisma ORM, Supabase Auth, Supabase Storage.\nAI Integration: Vercel AI SDK (v5+) for streaming responses and OpenAI GPT-4.\nDeployment: Vercel serverless.\n\nNon-Functional: HIPAA-compliant, RLS in Supabase, FHIR R4-aligned Prisma schema, clean/professional UI, accessible, responsive."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
2. Extract key concepts: actors (healthcare providers, patients, AI/automation), actions (view/search/manage records, AI support, analytics, documentation, communication), data (patient records, clinical notes, analytics, team messages), constraints (HIPAA, RLS, FHIR, accessibility)
3. No ambiguities detected in provided description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
5. Generate Functional Requirements
6. Identify Key Entities
7. Run Review Checklist
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A healthcare provider logs in to a secure dashboard, searches for a patient, reviews their record, uses AI tools for clinical decision support, documents a visit with AI-assisted notes, and communicates with the care team.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a provider login, **When** accessing the dashboard, **Then** they can search/view/manage patient records securely.
2. **Given** a patient record, **When** using the AI tools, **Then** the system provides real-time risk assessment, diagnostic suggestions, and drug interaction checks.
3. **Given** a clinical encounter, **When** documenting, **Then** the provider can use AI to generate notes and voice-to-text transcription.
4. **Given** a care team, **When** using the dashboard, **Then** they can securely message and manage tasks.
5. **Given** analytics access, **When** viewing the analytics section, **Then** interactive charts for clinical metrics are available.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a provider tries to access a record they are not authorized for?
- How does the system handle AI model downtime or errors?
- What if a file upload fails or is too large?
- How are audit logs and access tracked for compliance?
- What if a user attempts to bypass RLS or access data outside their scope?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow secure login and enforce RLS for all data access.
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a patient management hub for searching, viewing, and managing records.
